# 🧠 Core Implementations

## 1️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 🔹 From-Scratch Implementation

A manual implementation of the KNN algorithm including:

- Custom distance computation
- Hybrid metric design:
  - Manhattan distance → Numeric features
  - Hamming distance (0/1) → Categorical features
- Majority voting classification logic

This version demonstrates deep understanding of:

- Distance-based learning  
- Feature engineering  
- Algorithmic complexity  

---

### 🔹 Library-Based Benchmark

Implemented using **scikit-learn’s KNeighborsClassifier** for performance comparison against the custom logic.

This allows benchmarking between:

- Mathematical implementation  
- Optimized production model  

---

### 🎯 Domain: Sports Analytics

The dataset focuses on predicting football player positions:

- DF → Defender  
- MF → Midfielder  
- FW → Forward  
- GK → Goalkeeper  

Predictions are based on real performance statistics.

---

## 2️⃣ Naive Bayes

### 🔹 Custom Mixed Naive Bayes

The implementation supporting mixed feature types:

- Gaussian probability distributions → Continuous academic features  
- Laplace-smoothed categorical probabilities → Demographic features  

This implementation demonstrates understanding of:

- Bayes Theorem  
- Conditional independence assumption  
- Likelihood estimation  
- Numerical stability  

---

### 🔹 Production Pipeline Version

Built using scikit-learn with:

- Pipeline  
- ColumnTransformer  
- SimpleImputer  
- StandardScaler  
- OneHotEncoder  

Capabilities include:

- Automatic missing value handling  
- Feature scaling  
- Categorical encoding  
- Data leakage prevention  
- Clean train/test separation  

---

### 🎯 Domain: Educational Data

The model predicts student dropout risk using:

- Academic performance metrics  
- Socio-demographic variables  

---

# 📊 Model Evaluation Strategy

Each algorithm (custom and library-based) is evaluated using:

### ✔ Accuracy  
Overall prediction correctness.

### ✔ Average Specificity  
Measures the ability to correctly identify negative classes across multiple labels.

### ✔ Classification Report  
Includes:
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Support  

### ✔ Confusion Matrix  
Visualized using matplotlib to analyze misclassification patterns.

This ensures consistent and fair comparison between implementations.
